Gym was closed for Independence Day, but stayed on track with personal goals
Planned to begin exam registrations and reinforced the mindset of giving it my all
Realized the biggest obstacle is myself, and chose peace over happiness or sadness
Talked to friends like Venkat and Anirudh, keeping connections active
Studied a few subjects and completed all daily tasks
Decided to stay consistent, start with aptitude, and carry the motto: no emotions, no reactions

| Iâ€™ll focus on one habit at a time, starting by waking up     |
| before 6 AM. After waking, Iâ€™ll spend 5-10 minutes in peace  |
| to clear my mind before diving into the day. In the evenings,|
| Iâ€™ll take time to journal and reflect on the day. With new    |
| GATE subjects like verbal ability and algorithms coming up,  |
| Iâ€™ll avoid overloading myself with too much information. Iâ€™ll |
| take things slow, stay consistent, and not stress if I miss  |
| a day.                                                       |

| Today was inspiring â€” I hit the gym early, came out of my   |
| comfort zone, studied, and learned an important truth:      |
| if I donâ€™t want something, I donâ€™t need to suffer through   |
| it. Simply saying "no" saves me pain and gives me freedom.  |
|                                                             |
| I realized that following my dharma, doing the work I am    |
| assigned without fear of the outcome, is the true path to   |
| success. Whether results bring gain or loss, joy or sorrow, |
| I will remain peaceful. Even if no one stands with me, I    |
| know He is always watching over me and protecting me.       |
|                                                             |
| From tomorrow morning, I will preach, search, and live by   |
| dharma, focusing on peace and discipline in all I do.       |

Journal Entry â€“ 22-08-25

Today I realized something important: I canâ€™t focus on too many things at once. Right now, my capacity is two things, and thatâ€™s okay. Trying to learn multiple programming languages quickly feels immature and unnecessary. So, Iâ€™ve officially decided to stick with Python. Whether itâ€™s AI, ML, DL, data handling, or even math, I want to build everything with this one language. For the first time, I can see a clear path ahead.

Looking back, some decisions change your life. The first for me was joining the gym, and now this feels like the second big one. Also, I had a talk with Krishna during my low phaseâ€”his words genuinely lifted me and gave me the push to keep fighting my inner battles.

As for studies, I was advised to attend lectures first and make proper notes before focusing on DPPs. That makes senseâ€”get the foundation right, then practice. So for now, my goal is simple: finish the notes and attend lectures consistently.
