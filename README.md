📘 About This Repository
This is a digital space where I document my learning journey, growth, and interests over time. It serves as a personal archive — a place to collect experiences, ideas, projects, certifications, experiments, and anything else that reflects who I am and what I’m building or exploring.

🎯 Purpose
I started this repository with the intention of having a single place to organize and store all aspects of my development — both as a student and as a curious individual. Over time, it has grown into a reflection of my path: technically, personally, and creatively.

Whether it's a piece of code, a certificate I earned, a note from a tutorial I followed, or an experiment I tried on a weekend — it's all part of the process. This repository helps me track that process and revisit it anytime.
