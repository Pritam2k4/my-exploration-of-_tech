Gym was closed for Independence Day, but stayed on track with personal goals
Planned to begin exam registrations and reinforced the mindset of giving it my all
Realized the biggest obstacle is myself, and chose peace over happiness or sadness
Talked to friends like Venkat and Anirudh, keeping connections active
Studied a few subjects and completed all daily tasks
Decided to stay consistent, start with aptitude, and carry the motto: no emotions, no reactions

| Iâ€™ll focus on one habit at a time, starting by waking up     |
| before 6 AM. After waking, Iâ€™ll spend 5-10 minutes in peace  |
| to clear my mind before diving into the day. In the evenings,|
| Iâ€™ll take time to journal and reflect on the day. With new    |
| GATE subjects like verbal ability and algorithms coming up,  |
| Iâ€™ll avoid overloading myself with too much information. Iâ€™ll |
| take things slow, stay consistent, and not stress if I miss  |
| a day.                                                       |
